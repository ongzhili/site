## Future Values and Compound Interest

Future Value
- Amount which an investment will grow after earning interest
- = $principlevalue * (1 + r)^t$
    - r = interest rate
    - t = time (years / months) (based on r)

Compound Interest
- Interest earned on interest + original principle amount

Simple Interest
- Interest earned on original principle amount

## Present Values

Present Value
- Value today of a future cash flow
- = $\\frac{future-value-after-t-periods}{(1+r)^t}$ 
    - Basically the opposite of the FV formula

Discount Factor
- Present value of a **$1** future payment
- = $\\frac{1}{(1+r)^t}$ 
    - Basically the opposite of the FV formula, with FV of $1

Discount rate
- Interest rate used to compute present values of future cash flows


## Perpetuities and Annuities

Perpetuities
- Stream of level cash payments that never ends
- PV of **perpetuity**: $PV = \\frac{C}{r}$
    - C: Cash payment (how much you get per month / year)
    - r: Interest rate

Annuities
- Level stream of cash flows at regular intervals with a finite maturity
- PV of **annuity** formula: $PV = C[\\frac{1}{r} - \\frac{1}{r(1+r)^t}]$
    - C: Cash payment (how much you get per month / year)
    - r: interest rate
    - t: Number of years cash payment is recieved
