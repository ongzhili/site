## Goals of the Corporation

Shareholders desire wealth maximization

    - Maximize current year's earnings at the cost of future income

Opportunity Cost of Capital
- Minimum acceptable rate of return on capital investment
- _"If you can't make this amount of money, you better return to them as a dividend"_

## Agency Problem

Do managers maximize shareholder wealth or manager wealth?

Managers have many constituencies called "Stakeholders"
- Anyone with a finalcian interest in the corpo
- Agency problem
    - Managers are agents for stockholders
    - Tempted to act in their own interests rather than shareholder value
    - e.g paying employees more going against stakeholders wishes (of profit)
- Agency cost
    - Value lost from agency problems / mitigating agency problems


### How to deal with the issue?
